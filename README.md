This program backups the current working directory in your unix file system.

It creates a backup directory named something like 'backup-Sun_Nov_16_23:45:58_2014'

By default this program copies all files modified since most recent backup. 
If command line arguments are passed, e.g. 'backup_working_directory example_file.c example_file.h'
only the filenames passed as arguments will be backed up.
